Barebones Discord bot library code

Notable features are:

- ability to choose library backend for json, websocket, zip
- command macros with command data serialized into macrocache nodes
- optional ETF support (at compile time)
- concept instead of callback for event handling (not that it would improve performance)

This is mostly an experiment. Better interface, performance, examples may come later.
